{"question_id": 1, "prompt": "Beth places four whole ice cubes in a frying pan at the start of the first minute, then five at the start of the second minute and some more at the start of the third minute, but none in the fourth minute. If the average number of ice cubes per minute placed in the pan while it was frying a crispy egg was five, how many whole ice cubes can be found in the pan at the end of the third minute?\nA. 30\nB. 0\nC. 20\nD. 10\nE. 11\nF. 5\n", "ground_truth": "B", "explanantion": "In the problem, Beth adds a specific number of ice cubes per minute to a pan, and we need to find how many ice cubes are in the pan after three minutes, given the average number of ice cubes added per minute over four minutes. We calculated that she adds a total of 20 ice cubes across 4 minutes. With the number of ice cubes added being 4 in the first minute, 5 in the second minute, and calculated 11 in the third minute, the total after three minutes is 20 cubes. Therefore, the answer is C, which corresponds to 20 cubes.", "predicted_truth": "C"}
