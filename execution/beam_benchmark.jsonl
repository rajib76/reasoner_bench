With this average, the total number of cubes is 20 (5 cubes per minute * 4 minutes). For the specific calculation, you know the cubes added in the first two minutes were 4 and 5 respectively. Let x be the cubes added in the third minute. Set up the equation: 4 + 5 + x + 0 (since the fourth minute is not described with additional cubes) = 20. Solving for x gives you 11 cubes. Therefore, at the end of the third minute, the total is 4 + 5 + 11 = 20 cubes, making the final answer 20, corresponding to option C.", "predicted_truth": "C", "cost": 0.008155}

Thus, when the juggler climbs the ladder, the purple ball is likely still in its ascent or beginning descent, whereas the blue ball, with its shorter flight time, is either descending much earlier or has already descended.
