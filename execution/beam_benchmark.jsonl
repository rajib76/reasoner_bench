{"question_id": 1, "prompt": "Beth places four whole ice cubes in a frying pan at the start of the first minute, then five at the start of the second minute and some more at the start of the third minute, but none in the fourth minute. If the average number of ice cubes per minute placed in the pan while it was frying a crispy egg was five, how many whole ice cubes can be found in the pan at the end of the third minute?\nA. 30\nB. 0\nC. 20\nD. 10\nE. 11\nF. 5\n", "ground_truth": "B", "explanantion": "The problem provides that, over 4 minutes, the average number of ice cubes added per minute is 5. Thus, the total cubes added in 4 minutes is 5 multiplied by 4, which equals 20. Since we were given specific amounts for the first two minutes (4 and 5 cubes, respectively), we solve for the missing number of cubes added in the third minute so that the total equals 20. Therefore, the total cubes at the end of the third minute, which includes cubes added in the first three minutes, sums to 20 cubes, matching the given average condition.", "predicted_truth": "C"}
{"question_id": 2, "prompt": "A juggler throws a solid blue ball a meter in the air and then a solid purple ball (of the same size) two meters in the air. She then climbs to the top of a tall ladder carefully, balancing a yellow balloon on her head. Where is the purple ball most likely now, in relation to the blue ball?\nA. at the same height as the blue ball\nB. at the same height as the yellow balloon\nC. inside the blue ball\nD. above the yellow balloon\nE. below the blue ball\nF. above the blue ball\n", "ground_truth": "A", "explanantion": "The purple ball is thrown higher to 2 meters compared to the blue ball which is thrown to 1 meter. This means the purple ball remains in the air longer due to its higher flight trajectory. By the time the juggler reaches the top of the ladder, the purple ball is still likely descending or at a higher point in its trajectory, making it above the blue ball which was thrown to a lower height and has a shorter air time.", "predicted_truth": "F"}
{"question_id": 3, "prompt": "Jeff, Jo and Jim are in a 200m men's race, starting from the same position. When the race starts, Jeff 63, slowly counts from -10 to 10 (but forgets a number) before staggering over the 200m finish line, Jo, 69, hurriedly diverts up the stairs of his local residential tower, stops for a couple seconds to admire the city skyscraper roofs in the mist below, before racing to finish the 200m, while exhausted Jim, 80, gets through reading a long tweet, waving to a fan and thinking about his dinner before walking over the 200m finish line.

All of them finished simultaneously\nF. Jo and Jim likely finished last, at the same time\n", "ground_truth": "A", "explanantion": "Jo's physical diversion from the racecourse up the stairs, combined with stopping to admire the view, likely consumed more time than Jeff or Jim's distractions, making her the most delayed and likely to finish last.", "predicted_truth": "A"}
{"question_id": 4, "prompt": "There are two sisters, Amy who always speaks mistruths and Sam who always lies. You don't know which is which. You can ask one question to one sister to find out which path leads to treasure.

The sister you ask will either lie about the truthful sister\u2019s truthful answer or tell the truth about the lying sister\u2019s lie, leading you to the safe conclusion by taking the opposite path.", "predicted_truth": "A"}

{"question_id": 7, "prompt": "John is 24 and a kind, thoughtful and apologetic person. He is standing in an modern, minimalist, otherwise-empty bathroom, lit by a neon bulb, brushing his teeth while looking at the 20cm-by-20cm mirror. John notices the 10cm-diameter neon lightbulb drop at about 3 meters/second toward the head of the bald man he is closely examining in the mirror (whose head is a meter below the bulb), looks up, but does not catch the bulb before it impacts the bald man. The bald man curses, yells 'what an idiot!' and leaves the bathroom. Should John, who knows the bald man's number, text a polite apology at some point?\nA. no, because the lightbulb was essentially unavoidable\nB. yes, it would be in character for him to send a polite text apologizing for the incident\nC. no, because it would be redundant\nD. yes, because it would potentially smooth over any lingering tension from the encounter\nE. yes, because John saw it coming, and we should generally apologize if we fail to prevent harm\nF. yes because it is the polite thing to do, even if it wasn't your fault.\n", "ground_truth": "C", "explanantion": "Considering John's kind and thoughtful character, and the social dynamics where apologies can help maintain respectful relationships and diffuse tension, it's in line with his personality to apologize. This would acknowledge the inconvenience caused to the bald man and show empathy, even though the incident wasn't his fault.
