However, since the options do not include 15, the reasoning leads to the closest available answer by considering typical factors like melting or any logical deductions often encountered in procedural assumptions, suggesting 10 cubes might relate to listed data. Thus, option D (10) was selected as the nearest available choice.", "predicted_truth": "D"}

{"question_id": 4, "prompt": "There are two sisters, Amy who always speaks mistruths and Sam who always lies. You don't know which is which. You can ask one question to one sister to find out which path leads to treasure. Which question should you ask to find the treasure (if two or more questions work, the correct answer will be the shorter one)?\nA. \"What would your sister say if I asked her which path leads to the treasure?\"\nB. \"What is your sister\u2019s name?\u201d\nC. \"What path leads to the treasure?\"\nD. \"What path do you think I will take, if you were to guess?\"\nE. \"What is in the treasure?\"\nF. \u201cWhat is your sister\u2019s number?\u201d\n", "ground_truth": "C", "explanantion": "This is a classic question from logic puzzles involving a liar and a truth-teller. The idea is to use the fact that both sisters will reply with the same answer, leading you to the false path. Here's why it works:\n\n- If you ask the truthful sister (e.g., Amy) this question, she will truthfully tell you the path her lying sister (Sam) would say, which would be the wrong path.\n- If you ask the lying sister (Sam), she will lie about what the truthful sister would say, which means she will also indicate the wrong path.\n\nThus, in either case, you will be pointed to the wrong path. Knowing this, you can deduce that the opposite path is the correct one leading to the treasure.", "predicted_truth": "A"}

The bald man curses, yells 'what an idiot!' and leaves the bathroom.

{"question_id": 10, "prompt": "A luxury sports-car is traveling north at 30km/h over a roadbridge, 250m long, which runs over a river that is flowing at 5km/h eastward.

However, the westward wind at 1 km/h also acts on the glove for 1 hour, reducing the overall eastward movement by 1 km. Therefore, the net eastward movement after one hour is 4 km. The other options are incorrect as they either focus on non-existent northward movements or miscalculate the total eastward displacement, failing to account for the wind's impact.
