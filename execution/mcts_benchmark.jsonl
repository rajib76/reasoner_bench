{"question_id": 1, "prompt": "Beth places four whole ice cubes in a frying pan at the start of the first minute, then five at the start of the second minute and some more at the start of the third minute, but none in the fourth minute. If the average number of ice cubes per minute placed in the pan while it was frying a crispy egg was five, how many whole ice cubes can be found in the pan at the end of the third minute?\nA. 30\nB. 0\nC. 20\nD. 10\nE. 11\nF. 5\n", "ground_truth": "B", "explanantion": "To arrive at the answer, we first determine that Beth added a total of 20 ice cubes over four minutes with an average of five cubes per minute. In trying to achieve the total addition of 20 cubes, we assess the number added in each of the first three minutes: 4 cubes in the first, 5 in the second, and deduce the third must have 11 cubes to meet the average requirements disregarding what wasn't added in the fourth logical mathematical allocation for three-minute values. Therefore, the ice cubes' total added by the end of the third minute is 20.", "predicted_truth": "C"}
