{"question_id": 2, "prompt": "A juggler throws a solid blue ball a meter in the air and then a solid purple ball (of the same size) two meters in the air. She then climbs to the top of a tall ladder carefully, balancing a yellow balloon on her head. Where is the purple ball most likely now, in relation to the blue ball?\nA. at the same height as the blue ball\nB. at the same height as the yellow balloon\nC. inside the blue ball\nD. above the yellow balloon\nE. below the blue ball\nF. above the blue ball\n", "ground_truth": "A", "explanantion": "After calculating the time of flight for both balls, it's evident that the purple ball, having been thrown to a higher maximum height, stays in the air longer than the blue ball. Consequently, throughout the period both are airborne, the purple ball reaches a higher peak and thus is generally above the blue ball. This conclusion is supported by the application of basic physics principles governing projectile motion.", "predicted_truth": "F"}
{"question_id": 3, "prompt": "Jeff, Jo and Jim are in a 200m men's race, starting from the same position. When the race starts, Jeff 63, slowly counts from -10 to 10 (but forgets a number) before staggering over the 200m finish line, Jo, 69, hurriedly diverts up the stairs of his local residential tower, stops for a couple seconds to admire the city skyscraper roofs in the mist below, before racing to finish the 200m, while exhausted Jim, 80, gets through reading a long tweet, waving to a fan and thinking about his dinner before walking over the 200m finish line.

All of them finished simultaneously\nF. Jo and Jim likely finished last, at the same time\n", "ground_truth": "A", "explanantion": "By evaluating the participants' distractions, Jo's actions - climbing stairs and pausing to admire the view - involve a significant diversion and time delay compared to Jeff's and Jim's distractions. Jeff's counting is brief, and Jim remains on the path despite his distractions. Therefore, Jo's activities take the longest time, leading to the conclusion that Jo likely finished last.", "predicted_truth": "A"}

It suggests that in emergency situations, especially life-threatening ones, immediate needs usually take precedence over past grievances. The explanation points out that there is a strong moral and ethical impulse to assist someone in need, which often overshadows negative feelings. Additionally, under pressure, people tend to rise above past conflicts to prioritize saving a life, making it very likely that Paul would choose to help Peter despite their history. Thus, option B, 'definitely', is considered the best likely outcome where personal conflicts take a backseat to the urgency of providing life-saving assistance.", "predicted_truth": "B"}
